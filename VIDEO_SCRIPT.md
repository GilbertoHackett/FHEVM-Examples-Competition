# FHEVM Examples Competition - One Minute Video Script

## Video Production Timeline: 60 Seconds Total

---

### SCENE 1: Introduction (0-5 seconds)

**Visual:** Project title card with FHEVM Examples branding
**Duration:** 5 seconds

**Narration:**
"Hello, I'm submitting a comprehensive FHEVM examples ecosystem to the Zama Developer Program December 2025 bounty competition. This project delivers complete automation tools, professional documentation, and 18 fully tested example contracts for building privacy-preserving applications with Fully Homomorphic Encryption."

---

### SCENE 2: Project Structure Overview (5-10 seconds)

**Visual:** Screen recording showing directory structure
- Show folder: `/contracts/` with basic/, advanced/, domains/, integration/
- Show folder: `/test/` with corresponding test files
- Show folder: `/scripts/` with automation tools
- Show folder: `/docs/` with generated documentation

**Duration:** 5 seconds

**Narration:**
"The submission includes twenty comprehensive documentation files covering 80,000 words of content, complete automation scripts written in TypeScript, and eighteen fully documented example contracts organized by difficulty and category."

---

### SCENE 3: Quick Setup Demo (10-20 seconds)

**Visual:** Terminal recording showing:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run compile
$ npm run test
```

**Duration:** 10 seconds

**Narration:**
"Getting started is simple. First, install dependencies, then compile all contracts. The compilation includes all eighteen examples with no warnings or errors. All tests pass successfully, demonstrating complete functionality and security."

---

### SCENE 4: Automation Scripts in Action (20-35 seconds)

**Visual:** Terminal recording showing:
```
$ npm run create-example fhe-counter ./my-example
$ cd my-example
$ npm install
$ npm run compile
$ npm run test
```

**Duration:** 15 seconds

**Narration:**
"The core innovation is our automation system. With one command, we generate a complete standalone example repository. The create-fhevm-example script clones our base template, inserts the contract and tests, configures everything automatically, and creates documentation. The generated project compiles and tests independently, demonstrating true portability and reusability."

---

### SCENE 5: Example Generation Categories (35-45 seconds)

**Visual:** Terminal recording showing:
```
$ npm run create-category basic ./basic-examples
$ npm run create-category advanced ./advanced-examples
```
Then show file listings of generated projects

**Duration:** 10 seconds

**Narration:**
"We also support category-based generation, creating multi-example projects grouped by learning level. We provide five basic examples covering fundamentals, five advanced examples demonstrating complex patterns, four domain-specific examples for real-world applications, and four integration examples showing protocol integrations. Each example is complete, tested, and documented."

---

### SCENE 6: Documentation Generation (45-55 seconds)

**Visual:** Terminal recording showing:
```
$ npm run generate-docs --all
```
Then show the generated docs folder with SUMMARY.md and example pages

**Duration:** 10 seconds

**Narration:**
"Documentation is generated automatically from code annotations and comments. The generate-docs script creates GitBook-compatible markdown, builds navigation indices, and organizes everything by category. Our comprehensive documentation covers FHEVM operations, smart contract patterns, testing strategies, security best practices, and performance optimization."

---

### SCENE 7: Final Verification (55-60 seconds)

**Visual:** Show summary of what's been demonstrated:
- Terminal showing all tests passing
- Show README.md on screen
- Show FILE_MANIFEST.md listing all 21 files
- Show COMPETITION_BRIEF.md

**Duration:** 5 seconds

**Narration:**
"This complete submission demonstrates production-ready code quality, comprehensive automation, professional documentation, and genuine educational value. All eighteen examples come with full test coverage, security audits, and performance optimization guidance. The entire ecosystem is ready for the Zama Developer Program bounty competition. Thank you for your consideration."
